      <description>Container and serverless technologies bring important improvements to developer productivity. These technologies resolve developers&amp;rsquo; concerns about differences between production and development environments. They also improve applications&amp;rsquo; ability to execute more reliable and in scale. The two were being developed separately for a while and both have advantages and disadvantages.
